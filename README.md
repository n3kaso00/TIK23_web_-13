Hello

We are a group of students from Finland. The meaning of this project is to produce a educational and gamified website
for kids in lower elementary school. We chose to develop a history-themed site, which contains games located in different
"eras". In this project, one of our assignment was to develop an own personal page for each member of our student group,
so every era and the game related to it made by different person.
The games in the site have different difficulties, made by how much points (aka right answers etc.) is required to
get a "completion badge" from each history era. This project is our first developing assignment and represents
what we have learned during the first semester.

Site is made by:
